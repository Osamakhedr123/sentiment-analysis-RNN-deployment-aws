# SageMaker Deployment for an RNN Sentiment Analysis Model 
My goal in this project is to have a simple web page that a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to the deployed recurrent neural network model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.

## Training Data
For this notebook, I will be using the [IMDb dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
